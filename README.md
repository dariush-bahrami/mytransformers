# mytransformers

**mytransformers** is a Python package written from scratch in PyTorch that provides a
comprehensive set of building blocks for Transformers architectures. This package aims
to provide users with a deep understanding of Transformers and to give them full control
over designing new architectures.

The package includes all the components needed to build Transformer models, such as
attention mechanisms, feed-forward networks, positional encodings, etc. Transformer
models can be easily built using these building blocks in a flexible way.
